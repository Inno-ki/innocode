import config from "../../../config.mjs"
export const console = config.console

[**InnoCode**](/) is an open source AI coding agent. It's available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.

Let's get started.

---

#### Prerequisites

To use InnoCode in your terminal, you'll need:

1. A modern terminal emulator like:
   - [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform
   - [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform
   - [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS
   - [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS

2. API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

---

## Install

The easiest way to install InnoCode is through the install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://innocode.io/install | bash
```

You can also install it with the following commands:

- **Using Node.js**

        <Tabs>

      <TabItem label="npm">
      ```bash
      npm install -g @innogpt/innocode
      ```

          </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Bun">
        ```bash
        bun install -g @innogpt/innocode
        ```

          </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm install -g @innogpt/innocode
        ```

          </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn global add @innogpt/innocode
        ```

      </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

- **Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux**

  ```bash
  brew install InnoKI/tap/innocode
  ```

  > We recommend using the InnoCode tap for the most up to date releases. The official `brew install innocode` formula is maintained by the Homebrew team and is updated less frequently.

- **Using Paru on Arch Linux**

  ```bash
  paru -S innocode-bin
  ```

#### Windows

- **Using Chocolatey**

  ```bash
  choco install innocode
  ```

- **Using Scoop**

  ```bash
  scoop install innocode
  ```

- **Using NPM**

  ```bash
  npm install -g @innogpt/innocode
  ```

- **Using Mise**

  ```bash
  mise use -g github:InnoKI/innocode
  ```

- **Using Docker**

  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/InnoKI/innocode
  ```

Support for installing InnoCode on Windows using Bun is currently in progress.

You can also grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/InnoKI/innocode/releases).

## Configure

With InnoCode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

If you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using [InnoCode Zen](/zen).
It's a curated list of models that have been tested and verified by the InnoCode
team.

1. Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select innocode, and head to [innocode.io/auth](https://innocode.io/auth).

   ```txt
   /connect
   ```

2. Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.

3. Paste your API key.

   ```txt
   ┌ API key
   │
   │
   └ enter
   ```

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers. [Learn more](/providers#directory).

---

## Initialize

Now that you've configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that
you want to work on.

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

And run InnoCode.

```bash
innocode
```

Next, initialize InnoCode for the project by running the following command.

```bash frame="none"
/init
```

This will get InnoCode to analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in
the project root.

:::tip
You should commit your project's `AGENTS.md` file to Git.
:::

This helps InnoCode understand the project structure and the coding patterns
used.

---

## Usage

You are now ready to use InnoCode to work on your project. Feel free to ask it
anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might
help.

---

### Ask questions

You can ask InnoCode to explain the codebase to you.

:::tip
Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.
:::

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/api/index.ts"
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

This is helpful if there's a part of the codebase that you didn't work on.

---

### Add features

You can ask InnoCode to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

1. **Create a plan**

   InnoCode has a _Plan mode_ that disables its ability to make changes and
   instead suggest _how_ it'll implement the feature.

   Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You'll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.

   ```bash frame="none" title="Switch to Plan mode"
   <TAB>
   ```

   Now let's describe what we want it to do.

   ```txt frame="none"
   When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.
   Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.
   From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
   ```

   You want to give InnoCode enough details to understand what you want. It helps
   to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.

   :::tip
   Give InnoCode plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you
   want.
   :::

2. **Iterate on the plan**

   Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.

   ```txt frame="none"
   We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.
   [Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.
   ```

   :::tip
   Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.
   :::

   InnoCode can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can
   do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.

3. **Build the feature**

   Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to _Build mode_ by
   hitting the **Tab** key again.

   ```bash frame="none"
   <TAB>
   ```

   And asking it to make the changes.

   ```bash frame="none"
   Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
   ```

---

### Make changes

For more straightforward changes, you can ask InnoCode to directly build it
without having to review the plan first.

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/settings.ts" "@packages/functions/src/notes.ts"
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this is
handled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implement
the same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts
```

You want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so InnoCode makes the right
changes.

---

### Undo changes

Let's say you ask InnoCode to make some changes.

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/api/index.ts"
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

But you realize that it is not what you wanted. You **can undo** the changes
using the `/undo` command.

```bash frame="none"
/undo
```

InnoCode will now revert the changes you made and show your original message
again.

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/api/index.ts"
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

From here you can tweak the prompt and ask InnoCode to try again.

:::tip
You can run `/undo` multiple times to undo multiple changes.
:::

Or you **can redo** the changes using the `/redo` command.

```bash frame="none"
/redo
```

---

## Customize

And that's it! You are now a pro at using InnoCode.

To make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](/themes), [customizing the keybinds](/keybinds), [configuring code formatters](/formatters), [creating custom commands](/commands), or playing around with the [InnoCode config](/config).
